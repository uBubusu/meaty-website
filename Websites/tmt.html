          <p>Jeremiah Carson was in his daily walk through the swamps of Bayou Nwa to
            meet his alligator friends when all of a sudden he was interrupted by a strangely
            well balanced creature formed of seven cows, Kevin and Uncle.
            <br><br>
            "That creature was horrifying!", Jeremiah said, "That balance work is actually so
            impressive... i may discuss this with my fellow friends", an alligator said.
            <br><br>
            Some witnesses later saw the creature at Braithwaite Manor, trying to get into the building
            and even climbing to the roof.
            <br><br>
            Please if you encounter this creature don't get too close and report it to
            your nearest sheriff office.

            Rei Silver and Florence Miller, decided to interrupt the wedding and prevent the two lovebirds to achieve 
            their dreams.
            <br><br>
            Witnesses claimed the event took a very violent turn, with fire and explosives used as weapons.
            <br>
            "We at Braithwaite Manor were so happy for the pair, they looked perfect for each other, but those balds ruined 
            everything.", said Agatha Braithwaite, resident of the manor.
            <br><br>
            Not too far from the manor, two bodies were found hogtied and drowned on the shore, and a third body was 
            found underwater, although their remains later disappeared...

            "This is only the beginning, The Wondrous Silly Meaty Circus will soon host a longer and more varied

            been officially claimed by them: Belle Delaney, Caspian Yearwood and Kermit.
            <br><br>
            They seem to operate under suspicious matters, and they are known to manipulate their victims to convert 
            them into one of them, seeking for their vulnerabilities and giving their victims no other option than to 
            convert.
            <br><br>
            Caspian Yearwood and Kermit have reported having to convert to baldism so they
            could be resurrected, leaving them with no other choice.
            <br><br>
            They claim they aren't concerned about their new identity and that they really enjoy 
            it, which sadly indicates they are under they spell.
            <br><br>

            This trail involved a wide variety of pink-colored outfits and slaying drag songs, which ended up making the 
            participants sing to the top of their lungs throughout the entire journey.
            <br><br>
            The pink army then decided to end their iconic ride at Guarma's beach. The locals were stunned when they saw
            shiny pink-colored people approaching.
            <br><br>
            "At first I thought they were an actual army trying to invade us, but then 
            they started dancing at the beach with some loud tunes that actually sounded pretty cool", said Emilia Romero, Guarma resient.

          <h3>EPIC: THE MUSICAL TRAIL</h3>
          <p>A trail ride with Jorge Rivera-Herrans musical adaptation of Homer's Odyssey!</p>

        <div class="art-text e-art3-text">
          <p>Caspian Yearwood hosted a magnificent and epic trail ride in honor of Jorge Rivera-Herrans fantastical 
            adaptation of one of the best epic poetries ever, Odyssey by Homer (not The Simpsons one).
            <br><br>
            The trail followed the beat of the songs and the ambient ressembled the one the songs were expressing. It 
            was so interactive to the point where "Barold" and an army made an appearence, representing Polyphemus and 
            trojans.
            <br><br>
            The trail then hopped on canoes and made their way down through very large waterfalls and rocky obstacles, 
            making it a truly epic and heroic experience!

          <p>I already planned on doing a Meaty TV (MTV) section on the website because I wanted to make some videos and 
            even films about the meaty circus or other things... but things changed priority when JK realized they had 
            an hour long video about all the senanigans we were doing on the server... so expect a TV-styled website 
            (like an actual TV hehe) in the next few weeks hehe.
            <br><br>
            I'm even planning on doing video ads for the MTV hehehe, just imagine a 5-10 second video ad about the bald 
            gang just before the bald genesis upcoming movie starts...

            want to cause any trouble to the server stability, but I already fought with blender a few years ago when I 
            attempted to make a horse game on my own (lost motivation as always), but imagine a poster/board sign in the 
            game which displays an actual ad of a server facility... hmmmmm...
